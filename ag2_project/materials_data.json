  "query_explanation": "The user is asking for a list of oxide materials that have specific properties making them potentially useful for applications like electronics or photonics. The key term 'band_gap' refers to the energy difference between the highest occupied electronic band and the lowest unoccupied electronic band, with a range of 3\u20136 eV indicating wide bandgap materials suitable for high-power and high-frequency applications. The 'energy_above_hull' is a measure of the material's stability; a value of \u2264 0.05 eV typically suggests that the material is very close to its most stable form under equilibrium conditions. The user is seeking a summary of materials that fit these criteria, focusing on those that would likely be good candidates for further study or application.",
