# Data Sources and Handling — WildfiresAI

This project integrates multiple scientific data sources to support wildfire analysis and decision-making.
All large datasets are treated as external inputs and are not versioned in this repository.

---

## Overview

WildfiresAI combines:
- Satellite-derived fire detections
- Topographic information
- Meteorological and environmental context
- Materials and physical property data (via Materials Project)

The repository contains code and pipelines only.
Raw data files are either downloaded dynamically or generated locally and excluded from version control.

## Satellite Fire Data (NASA FIRMS)

Active fire detections are obtained from **NASA FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System)** using near–real-time satellite products:

- **VIIRS Suomi-NPP (NRT)**
- **MODIS (NRT)**

Fire data are accessed through the FIRMS API and parameterized by:
- Geographic bounding boxes (global and continental scales)
- Time windows (24 h and 7 days)

Environment variables generated by `setup_firms_env.sh` define all FIRMS endpoints used by the pipeline.
The FIRMS API key (`FIRMS_MAP_KEY`) is required locally but never committed.

---

## Topography and Elevation Data

Digital Elevation Model (DEM) tiles are used for terrain-aware analysis (slope, altitude, exposure).

- DEM files are large (≈50 MB per tile)
- Stored locally under `data/raw/`
- Explicitly excluded from version control via `.gitignore`

These datasets are reproducible and can be re-downloaded when needed.

---

## Meteorological and Environmental Data

The pipeline is designed to integrate weather and environmental inputs from external providers, including:

- ECMWF
- NOAA
- Copernicus / EFFIS
- National and regional feature services (e.g. NIFC)

Corresponding API endpoints and credentials are configured via environment variables.
These sources are optional and activated depending on the analysis scope.

---

## Materials and Physical Properties

WildfiresAI optionally interfaces with the **Materials Project** API to retrieve material-level physical properties relevant to infrastructure, terrain interaction, or mitigation strategies.

Access is controlled via `MP_API_KEY`, provided locally by the user.

---

## Data Management Policy

- No API keys or credentials are committed
- No large binary data files are committed
- All sensitive or machine-specific configuration is handled via `.env` (local only)
- A public `.env.example` template documents required variables

This approach ensures:
- Reproducibility
- Security
- Clean separation between code and data

---

## Reproducibility

All data used by the project can be regenerated using:
- The provided scripts
- Public APIs
- Documented environment variables

The repository remains lightweight while preserving full scientific transparency.
