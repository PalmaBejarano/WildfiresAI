# WildfiresAI

WildfiresAI is a research-grade experimental pipeline that combines
a controlled multi-agent LLM architecture (AG² / AutoGen) with
data-driven materials analysis via the Materials Project API.

The repository focuses on **explicit reasoning, strict tool boundaries,
and reproducible scientific analysis**, rather than end-user automation
or black-box inference.

---

## Core idea

The system is built as a **controlled multi-agent workflow** in which:

1. A user query is first **interpreted and formalized** in scientific terms.
2. The query is translated into **strictly valid Materials Project filters**.
3. Retrieved materials are **analyzed quantitatively**, not heuristically.
4. Optional downstream code execution is performed in a **sandboxed,
   traceable manner**, with outputs persisted to disk.

Each stage is isolated, validated, and explicitly routed.

## Architecture overview

The pipeline is implemented in `Pipeline WildfiresAI.ipynb` and follows
a fixed agent order:

Human → Agent A → Agent B → Agent C → Agent D → Human


### Agent A — Explainer
- Interprets the user’s question.
- Produces a concise scientific explanation.
- Does **not** retrieve data or generate conclusions.

### Agent B — Materials Retriever
- Translates the explanation into a **Materials Project query**.
- Enforces **hard whitelists** for:
  - allowed search criteria
  - allowed returned fields
- Rejects unsupported filters instead of silently correcting them.
- Stores raw results in shared context variables.

### Agent C — Analyzer
- Performs **data-grounded analysis** of retrieved materials.
- Interprets:
  - band gap → electronic / optical regime
  - energy above hull → thermodynamic stability
  - density → qualitative structural implications
- Produces a **strict JSON output** (no free-form text).
- Persists results to disk (`materials_data.json`).

### Agent D — Coding Agent
- Executes Python code **only via a controlled tool**.
- Typical tasks:
  - exporting CSV summaries
  - generating plots (e.g. band-gap histograms)
- Stores:
  - executed code
  - outputs
  - execution history
- No direct code execution outside the tool is allowed.

## Design principles

- **No hidden reasoning**: every transformation is explicit.
- **No hallucinated data**: all conclusions are derived from retrieved values.
- **Strict validation**: invalid inputs fail loudly.
- **Separation of concerns**: explanation, retrieval, analysis, and coding are isolated.
- **Reproducibility**: all intermediate artifacts are saved.
